            <p id="french fries info">The potatoes are cut into different shapes, such as wedges, curls, or, most commonly, thin strips.
                 After the optional but recommended step of blanching, the pieces are dried and then typically fried in a deep 
                fryer. The oil causes french fries to be high in fat, which is linked to cardiovascular disease and diabetes</p>
